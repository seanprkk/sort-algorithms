# sort-algorithms
Explores the time complexity of different sorting algorithms

### How to run:

1. Open integrated terminal of the src folder.
2. Type the "make" command to use the Makefile.
3. Either compare different sorting algorithms for a specific size ("./compare_sorts"), or compare runtimes of different array sizes for a specific algorithm ("./comapre_lengths").
